== How to install ==

To install you need to setup authentication with Google Analytics. To do this two methods are possible which are described below.

=== Authenticate using Client ID ===

This method will allow users to authenticate on their Google Account and access the reports for which they have rights on Google Analytics.
This method will not allow to show Google Analytics reports to non-authorized users.

Step 1/ Create a project and a client ID according to [[this Tutorial&gt;&gt;https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/javascript/start/start-js#Setup]]. 
Step 2/ Make sure to not forget to set the "Authorized Javascript Origin" to the URL of your web server.
Step 3/ Make sure to add the Google Analytics API to the APIs available for your project (still in the developer console)
Step 4/ Finally add the client ID to your [[Google Analytics Embed API Configuration&gt;&gt;XWiki.XWikiPreferences||queryString="editor=globaladmin&amp;section=Google+Analytics+Embed+API"]]

=== Authenticate using a Service Account ===

This method will allow to authenticate on the server side and will not require users to log-in on their user account. 
This method allows to show Google Analytics reports to any users. Users that can edit in the wiki will allow to access most of the Google Analytics data authorized to the Service Account.

Setting-up server authentication is explain on the [[Google Analytics Embed API web site&gt;&gt;https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/embed-api/server-side-authorization/]] and has a few steps:

Step 1/ Create a project and a service account according to [[this Tutorial&gt;&gt;https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#creatinganaccount]]. 
Step 2/ Make sure to add the Google Analytics API to the APIs available for your project (still in the developer console)
Step 3/ Once created, download the "p12" file and save it to your server in /WEB-INF/GoogleAnalytics.p12 of your XWiki installation
 (usually in webapps/xwiki/WEB-INF/. If you don't have access to the server, ask your Hosting Administrator.)
Step 4/ Add the service account with read rights to your Google Analytics Account
Step 5/ Finally add the service account to your [[Google Analytics Embed API Configuration&gt;&gt;XWiki.XWikiPreferences||queryString="editor=globaladmin&amp;section=Google+Analytics+Embed+API"]]

== Check the Demos ==

Verify your configration by accessing the [[Demo page&gt;&gt;Demo]]. This will also allow you to see the ID of your Google Analytics report which you can use in the macros in the next section.

== Use the Macros ==

The following macros are available:

=== gachart ===

This macro allows to add a chart of your Google Analytics data. This is a most common macro to use to make customized reports.
